\section{Design Decisions}


I choose Sieve of Eratosthenes method of finding primes as the large loops it requires to mark numbers as non prime seemed a good candidate for parallel running.
 Although I believe I could malloc a bitmap and pass it into the thread's function, for simplicity I made it global along with the max number and the current number to be checked.
  All threads share and increment the current odd number to be checked as prime. I used macros for the bitmap manipulation to make it easier to read the program.


\section{Difficulties}


Although I was able to come up with a serial implementation of Sieve of Eratosthenes, coming up with the structure to effectively parallelize the algorithm took a god deal of refinement.  
I started with an implementation that found the primes in one thread and marked them in another but I found it difficult to synchronize the data and eventually ended up with something that worked but was effectively serial.  
It used conditions to mutex locks to block everything until a prime was found, then the primes loop would be locked until all non-primes were marked.  
It took a step back and other look a day later to find a solution without locking, which is the only way an implementation could find 2\verb|^|32 primes in under 45 secs. My algorithm was able to find all primes in 2\verb|^|32 in 17 secs with 8 threads on my personal computer.

Sat Feb 25 12:39:24 2012 -0800      &   added another condition variable, pretty much just works like a serial alg now...   \\
Fri Feb 24 17:41:29 2012 -0800      &   changed limit to max. Working, but only with sleep(1)   \\
